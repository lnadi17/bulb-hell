# bulb-hell

This is a game made in Unity engine, very similar to the puzzle game called Lights Out. 
This project is complementary to my another project, [lights-yes](https://github.com/lnadi17/lights-yes/), which is a Jupyter Notebook dedicated 
to solving this game using linear algebra methods. This game is currently published on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LukaNadiradze.LightsOn) for free and without ads. 
This repository is archived and no further development is planned for this game at this moment.
